    <p>The Roman Republic was established around <strong>509 BCE</strong> after the overthrow of the last Etruscan king, Tarquin the Proud. Initially, power was held by the Senate and elected officials known as magistrates. The Republic was characterized by a complex system of checks and balances among its various governing bodies.</p>
    
    <p>In the early years, conflicts arose between the <strong>patricians</strong> (aristocratic families) and <strong>plebeians</strong> (commoners). This tension led to the <strong>Conflict of the Orders</strong>, culminating in the creation of the office of the <strong>Tribune of the Plebs</strong>, which allowed plebeians to have representation and a voice in government.</p>
    
    <p>During the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE, Rome expanded significantly through military conquests, notably in the Italian Peninsula and during the <strong>Punic Wars</strong> against Carthage (264-146 BCE). These wars established Rome as a dominant power in the Mediterranean.</p>
    
    <p>By the 2nd century BCE, the Republic faced social and economic challenges, including wealth inequality and the rise of populist leaders like the <strong>Gracchi brothers</strong>, who sought land reforms. The political landscape became increasingly unstable, leading to a series of civil wars.</p>
    
    <p>The final decades of the Republic saw the rise of powerful generals like <strong>Marius</strong> and <strong>Sulla</strong>, who used their military might to influence politics. The Republic struggled with corruption, power struggles, and the increasing influence of military leaders, setting the stage for <strong>Julius Caesar's</strong> rise to power. Caesar's crossing of the <strong>Rubicon</strong> in 49 BCE marked the beginning of the end for the Republic, leading to his dictatorship and the eventual transition to the Roman Empire.</p>
